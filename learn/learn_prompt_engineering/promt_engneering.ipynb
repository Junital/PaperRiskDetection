      "The current paper review states that the physician relies on the wholeness of symptoms revealed during the entire evolution of the infection and prescribes an ultra-high diluted succussed solution product which has been proven to heal similar conditions. This suggests that the current paper review supports the assertion that homeopathy is based on the Hippocratic Similia Similibus Curentur therapeutic law, providing some evidence for its effectiveness in treating similar conditions.\n",
      "The current paper review criticizes the previous assertion made in the context by stating that it is unsupported by any fact or citation.
