    "retrieves 1,215 articles.   Some anthropometric measures and body composition indicators have been shown to be associated with endometriosis, \\ \n",
    "and specifically with the most severe forms of the disease (Backonja et al., 2017).   Endometriosis is associated with lean body size and \\ \n",
    "tall height (Farland et al., 2017), and may correlate with a peripheral body fat distribution (Shah et al. 2013). According to Hediger \\ \n",
    "et al. (2005), the observation \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cthat women diagnosed with endometriosis may have a consistently lean physique during \\ \n",
    "adolescence and young adulthood lends support to the suggestion of there being an in utero or early childhood origin for endometriosis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d.  \\ \n",
    "In women with endometriosis, independent groups have observed a higher frequency of several characteristics that appear to be genetically \\ \n",
    "determined. As an example, associations between red hair, pale skin, naevi, and freckles has been repeatedly demonstrated (Woodworth et al., \\ \n",
    "1995; Missmer et al., 2006; Kvaskoff M et al., 2009 and 2014; Somigliana et al., 2010). The association between blue eye colour and deep, \\ \n",
    "infiltrating endometriosis is also very strong (Vercellini et al., 2014).  The anogenital distance (AGD), an indicator of intra-uterine \\ \n",
    "estrogenic androgenic exposure, is shorter in women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis, to the point that some \\ \n",
    "authors suggest this measure as a diagnostic tool specifically in women with deep, infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) and endometriomas\\ \n",
    " (Mendiola et al., 2016; S\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00e1nchez-Ferrer ML et al., 2017 and 2019).   In the words of the authors \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cThe AGD is known \\ \n",
    " to be a reliable biomarker of the prenatal hormonal environment, and a strong association has been recently reported between shorter AGD and \\ \n",
    " the presence of endometriomas, DIE, or both, in women\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d (S\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00e1nchez-Ferrer ML et al., 2017). The authors suggest that \\ \n",
    " endometriosis is associated with higher estrogen exposure during intra-uterine life.  Also, female facial attractiveness has been found to \\ \n",
    " be positively associated with low testosterone-to-oestradiol ratio and low testosterone (Probst F et al. 2016). According to the authors, an \\ \n",
    " attractive female face is shaped by interacting effects of testosterone and oestradiol.  Of particular interest here, Hu et al., in their \\ \n",
    " recent publication in PLOS Genetics titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cGenome-wide association study reveals sex-specific genetic architecture of facial \\ \n",
    " attractiveness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d, identified two genome-wide significant loci, highlighted a handful of candidate genes, and demonstrated \\ \n",
    " enrichment for heritability in human tissues involved in reproduction and hormone synthesis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d  .  The authors write \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cwe \\ \n",
    " conducted a GWAS to identify DNA variants associated with human facial attractiveness. We identified two genome-wide significant \\ \n",
    " loci on 10q11.22 and 2p22.2 and highlighted several genes via eQTL analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis. Human tissues \\ \n",
    " involved in reproduction and hormone production were implicated in heritability enrichment analysis. Additionally, we identified evidence \\ \n",
    " for shared genetics between attractiveness and other complex traits. Top SNPs for attractiveness were enriched for associations with dermatological \\ \n",
    " traits related to skin and hair pigmentation. Via a genome-wide genetic covariance estimation approach, we identified strong evidence for \\ \n",
    " shared genetic architecture of facial attractiveness with BMI [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2026] These results not only provided fundamental new insights into \\ \n",
    " the genetic basis of facial attractiveness, but also revealed the complex relationship between attractiveness and a variety of human \\ \n",
    " traits.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d  Interestingly, female attractiveness traits were negatively correlated with BMI traits and positively correlated \\ \n",
    " with some dermatological traits. According to White and Puts (2019) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cthe candidate genes identified for both significant results \\ \n",
    " and nearly all suggestive results have entries in GWAS Catalog for traits related to attractiveness, including skin pigmentation and melanoma, \\ \n",
    " body mass index (BMI), and the BMI related phenotypes of height and waist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2013hip ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d.  Thus, it appears that an \\ \n",
    " underlying specific genetic architecture mediates attractiveness. Moreover, facial attractiveness seems related to some phenotypic \\ \n",
    " characteristics that have been observed more frequently in women with endometriosis. Therefore, facial attractiveness might be associated \\ \n",
    " with a genetically influenced intra-uterine estrogenic androgenic balance that may determine, with various pathogenic mechanisms, the future \\ \n",
    " development of endometriosis, especially in its more invasive forms.  If, in addition to genetic predisposition, female facial attractiveness \\ \n",
    " is partly influenced by an intrauterine estrogenic androgenic imbalance, as it seems to be the case with deep infiltrating endometriosis (Mendiola \\ \n",
    " et al., 2016; S\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00e1nchez-Ferrer ML et al. 2017 and 2019), prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors should be studied more in-depth (Wei \\ \n",
    " et al., 2016), as this might open the possibility of limiting the risk of the most severe disease forms. Indeed, an association between exposure \\ \n",
    " to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls, or organochlorine pesticides and deep infiltrating endometriosis \\ \n",
    " has been repeatedly observed (Mart\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u00ednez-Zamora et al., 2015; Ploteau S et al., 2016 and 2017).  Data available at the moment of \\ \n",
    " planning our study already suggested the hypothesis of an interaction between genetic and endocrine factors, and the evidence that emerged in \\ \n",
    " recent years seems to further confirm the rationale behind our study.  Given this scenario, some aspects regarding our study should be described \\ \n",
    " in detail to avoid misunderstanding.   First, participants were aware that the study was aimed at investigating several clinical data, including \\ \n",
    " past medical and sexual history, several phenotypic variables, and also attractiveness. Institutional review board approval was obtained and the \\ \n",
    " women signed an informed consent form.   Second, the visit included three separate phases. Initially, the women were requested to read and fill \\ \n",
    " in the questionnaires. This is part of the regular activity of our service, as all patients referred to our centre systematically complete several\\ \n",
    "   forms aimed at defining their overall health, type and severity of symptoms, psychological status, sexual functioning, and health-related quality \\ \n",
    "   of life.   When the patients returned the questionnaires, body measurements were obtained in a dedicated room exclusively by two female \\ \n",
    "   investigators. Indeed, as indicated in the article, the observers that rated face attractiveness during the final part of the visit, were not \\ \n",
    "   those who obtained body measurements.   Third, when face attractiveness was observed, the participants had already finished the physical \\ \n",
    "   examination, were dressed, talking with the physician, and ready to leave the outpatient clinic. The observers independently encountered the \\ \n",
    "   patients only at this phase. In other words, the observers that rated attractiveness could only look at the patients as in any other public \\ \n",
    "   situation and had no role in any other part of the visit. Maintaining that the same physicians performed a physical examination and then rated \\ \n",
    "   attractiveness is false and, again, this is clearly indicated in the published article. Observing facial attractiveness did not imply any \\ \n",
    "   particular action. Of note, two of the observers were female doctors.  We are astonished by the controversies arising several years after our \\ \n",
    "   study was published, particularly considering that the evidence that followed seems to be in line with our original hypothesis.   \\ \n",
    "   We do not understand also the accuse of racism. Is this because only women of Caucasian ethnicity were recruited? Ethnicity is fundamental \\ \n",
    "   when investigating the hypothetical genetic basis of diseases, and the preplanned inclusion of women of exclusively Caucasian origin was \\ \n",
    "   decided to prevent an obvious genetic bias that would have confounded the findings.  Finally, except for the assessment of facial \\ \n",
    "   attractiveness, there was no deviation from our standard clinical management. Nothing different was done with respect to our routine \\ \n",
    "   practice. Exclusively women with an already discussed and agreed surgical indication were considered. Reading that we performed \\ \n",
    "   surgery after the outpatient clinic evaluation to verify whether women had endometriosis or not is extremely offensive and defamatory.  \\ \n",
    "   In addition, our group is well known in the world for extreme commitment in putting women with endometriosis at the centre of all \\ \n",
    "   medical decisions. We are devoted to patient-centred medicine, and shared medical decision-making is the hallmark of our clinical \\ \n",
    "   and scientific activity. A quick look at our scientific production through PubMed would easily reveal our efforts toward setting-up \\ \n",
    "   the safest, clinically effective, and cost-effective treatment strategies (Vercellini et al., 2018a and 2018b). We are among the \\ \n",
    "   few who continue to fight against financial conflicts of interest and undue industry influence in gynecology in general, and in \\ \n",
    "   the endometriosis area in particular.  We have and always have had the maximum respect of our patients, and our group published the \\ \n",
    "   results of the first participatory research initiative in the endometriosis field together with a large patient association (Vercellini \\ \n",
    "   et al., 2018c).  We are appalled by the description made by some regarding our role as investigators. Of relevance, some of the authors \\ \n",
    "   of this study are involved in clinical and research activity against violence toward women (Barbara et al., 2017a; 2017b; 2017c), \\ \n",
    "   against genital cosmetic surgery (Barbara et al., 2015), and against female genital mutilation (Buggio et al., 2019). We are all very \\ \n",
    "   well aware of what it means living with endometriosis, and one of the co-authors lost a kidney many years ago owing to a severe form of \\ \n",
    "   endometriosis. How could we even imagine to disrespect the women we are trying to help to the maximum of our possibilities?  We believe \\ \n",
    "   that our findings are in line with a vast body of evidence demonstrating the role of genetics and probably of the intrauterine hormonal \\ \n",
    "   environment (findings that have opened new promising avenues of research), that the rationale behind our study was legitimate and followed \\ \n",

    "         and thus not only as a co-author of the paper under discussion (1), I acknowledge with overwhelming sorrow, but also some perplexity, your negative comments concerning both the methodological aspects and the legitimacy itself of the assessment of attractiveness of women with and without endometriosis.  Honestly, as a group, we did not think that our paper could have been received as an offense to women, and the possibility of conducting a highly sexist study was absolutely out of our perspective. Indeed, full respect of all women in general and of women with endometriosis in particular has always been\\ \n",
    "           our priority. We have fought for years to put the patients with endometriosis at the center of medical decisions and of the socio-political awareness (2) and I have been personally among the very few scientists on the side of the women\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s associations sustaining the disease recognition as a social disease.  With regard to methodology, I cannot exclude that your listed limits \\ \n",
    "           may have had an impact on the results. However, we \\ \n",
    "       have already explained and clarified in detail all these aspects both in the manuscript itself and in this online forum. With regard to the overall ethical aspects of the investigation and the accusation of highly sexist conduct, I would like to make some further considerations.  According to our vision, the ethical legitimacy of our investigation was based on the observation that face and human attractiveness in both females and males has been the objective of \\ \n",
    "       vast research in several fields of medicine for a long time. In order to further clarify our line of thinking, I refer to another well known example of strict interaction between genetic endocrine factors and expression of a particular phenotype, i.e., the complete androgen \\ \n",
    "       insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). The evidence for an attractive feminine phenotype of some subjects with CAIS is anecdotal, but apparently well radicated in gynecological knowledge. As an example, one of the most authoritative textbooks of gynecology reported \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2026] is a phenotypic female who is usually somewhat tall, has excellent breast development [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2026]. After puberty, the general habitus and distribution of body fat is entirely female\\ \n",
    "         in proportion and many of these women are strikingly attractive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019 (3). Similar comments can be found in other gynecological textbooks (4). Also patients themselves seem to be aware of this phenotype, which is sometimes felt as a sort of compensation (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018She nevertheless, was acutely aware of her physical attractiveness and was recorded as saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cAt least I can take comfort in my femininity\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019) (5).  On a scientific basis, there \\ \n",
    "         are evident parallelisms between these two conditions, especially considering the novel genetic findings underlying\\ \n",
    "         endometriosis risk (6). Mutations or polymorphisms of genes critical for the fetal development and variations in the intrauterine endocrine milieu are likely to determine different phenotypes in the adult age (7). Indeed, the potential role of intrauterine life on endometriosis development has recently been suggested based\\ \n",
    "           on a series of observations indicating a modification of the risk among women exposed to specific factors in utero (8). Finally, evidence to suggest antiandrogenic or estrogenic effects for certain environmental toxins is an added factor which merits further consideration for the etiology and for the variable expression of the involved genes.  As established concepts on feminine phenotype and attractiveness were already present in the literature, I and we all as a group \\ \n",
    "           did not expect that our investigation could have ignited such a great resentment and could have been received as a grave gender offence. We certainly did not imagine that reporting an excess of attractive women among the patients with a particular endometriotic lesion\\ \n",
    "             could have increased the risk of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders or that measuring physical variables could be interpreted as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201cobjectifying women\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s bodies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u201d. In addition, and for sake of clarity, the raters encountered the women exclusively when they were completely dressed.

      "The current paper review criticizes a study that evaluates physical attractiveness in women with and without endometriosis. The reviewer expresses strong disapproval, stating that the study is unethical, immoral, and methodologically flawed. They question the approval process and oversight by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The reviewer also provides links to comments and responses from other sources discussing the study's publication and its implications. However, the authors of the study argue that studying attractiveness is not inherently sexist and that it can contribute to understanding physiological and pathological conditions. They mention previous research linking certain anthropometric measures and body composition indicators to endometriosis. Additionally, genetic associations with characteristics such as red hair, pale skin, freckles, and blue eye color have been observed in women with endometriosis. The review also mentions the association between anogenital distance (AGD) and endometriosis, suggesting it as a potential diagnostic tool. The authors of the study also highlight the relationship between female facial attractiveness and hormone levels. They reference a recent genome-wide association study that identified genetic factors related to facial attractiveness and reproductive hormones.\n",

      "The current paper review discusses a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that aimed to identify DNA variants associated with human facial attractiveness. The study identified two significant loci and highlighted several genes related to reproduction and hormone production. It also found evidence for shared genetics between attractiveness and other complex traits. The review mentions that top SNPs for attractiveness were associated with dermatological traits related to skin and hair pigmentation. The authors suggest that facial attractiveness may be influenced by an intrauterine estrogenic androgenic balance, which could be related to the development of endometriosis. They propose further research on prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors to potentially reduce the risk of severe forms of the disease.\n",

The authors clarify that the study was conducted with proper ethical approval and informed consent from participants. They explain the process of data collection, which involved questionnaires, body measurements, and face attractiveness ratings by independent observers. The authors emphasize that the observers had no role in any other part of the visit and that the same physicians did not rate attractiveness or perform surgery based on the evaluation. They refute accusations of racism, stating that the inclusion of women of exclusively Caucasian origin was to prevent genetic bias. The authors assert their commitment to patient-centered medicine and their efforts to fight against conflicts of interest and industry influence. They highlight their involvement in research against violence towards women and other related issues. Overall, the authors defend the legitimacy and rationale of their study, which aligns with existing evidence on genetics and the intrauterine hormonal environment.\n",

      "The current paper review is a response to criticisms and controversies surrounding a previous study on genetic and endocrine factors associated with facial attractiveness and endometriosis. The author of the review defends the legitimacy and ethical conduct of their study, stating that it was conducted with proper approval and informed consent. They address accusations of racism, explaining that the inclusion of women of exclusively Caucasian origin was to prevent genetic bias. They also emphasize their commitment to patient-centered medicine and their involvement in research against violence towards women.\n",

      "However, the Executive Committee of the Mental Health Professional Group of ASRM expresses concerns about the previous study. They argue that the study was deceptive in not informing participants about the attractiveness ratings and criticize the subjective nature of the ratings. They also argue that the study is not clinically useful and criticize its sexist premise.\n",

      "In the current paper review, the author defends their study, stating that the assessment of attractiveness is a legitimate area of research and citing examples of similar studies in other fields of medicine. They express sorrow and perplexity at the negative comments and assure that their intention was never to offend women or conduct a sexist study. They emphasize their commitment to respecting women and their efforts to prioritize the well-being of patients with endometriosis. They acknowledge the listed limitations of their study but argue that they have already addressed and clarified these aspects. They also refer to the example of the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome to support their line of thinking.\n",

It mentions the novel genetic findings underlying endometriosis risk and suggests considering the effects of environmental toxins on the etiology and variable expression of involved genes. The author expresses surprise at the negative reception of their investigation and clarifies that the assessment of attractiveness was based solely on facial characteristics and not on objectifying women's bodies.\n",
